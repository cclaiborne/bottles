# Hello Applicant

If you're seeing this README, we'd like you to complete the following two tasks:

1. Answer all the question below.
2. Submit code for the projects below.

## Questions

Please answer the following questions.

1. Name a few technologies or frameworks that excite you. Why? What experience do you have with them?
2. What is your current favorite web application and why?
3. Besides programming, what other hobbies or interests do you have?
4. Tell us about a project you've worked on or a problem that you've solved that you're particularly proud of. What challenges did you face and how did you overcome them?
5. What resources are you currently using to learn or expand your knowledge of software development (blogs, communities, books, etc.)?
6. In a few sentences, describe object oriented programming. What is a class? What are objects?
7. Explain, to the best of your knowledge, how a URL request is routed from your browser to a web server, then through the Rails stack before finally returning a web page to the user.
8. What are your current salary requirements?

## Projects

Please submit code for the following projects:

### Bottles Song

Make the tests in `bottles_song_test.rb` pass.

You can run the tests from the command line with `ruby bottles_song_test.rb`, or the provided rake task `rake test`.

### Awesomeness

Create a Ruby class that is initialized with an array of objects. Instances of your newly created class should be able to identify the most awesome object, the average awesomeness of all the objects, and it should provide a method that will print out a list of the top 10 most awesome objects. Make sure to include tests.

Each object in the array should have two properties:

- name (String)
- awesomeness (Integer)

### Zebra Striping

You have some tabular data of the form:

```
Heroes     | Weapon of Choice
------     | ----------------
Batman     | Utility Belt
Superman   | Laser Eyes
Spider-Man | Spidey Sense
Aquaman    | Trident
```

Using any technologies you would like, create a solution that will display this information in a zebra-striped (alternating hi-lighting) list of items.
